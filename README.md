# HexWeb, II
[HexWeb](https://github.com/TechTastic/HexWeb) is an awesome idea that I love, but I can't figure out how to get it installed (Requires both Minecraft 1.20.1 *and* MoreIotas, which is 1.19.2 only), nor can I figure out how to backport it to 1.19.2.
So I'm just gonna make my own shittier version.
